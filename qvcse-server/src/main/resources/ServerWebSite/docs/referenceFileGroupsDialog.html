<h1>Define File Groups Dialog</h1>
<p>From the <b>Admin&rarr;Define File Groups...</b> menu, you can display the Define File Groups dialog.</p>
<p>You can use the Define File Groups dialog to enable and disable "File Group" behavior, as well as to define what file extensions should comprise a given file group.</p>
<p>File Groups are a useful way to cause the client application to treat files that share the same name (except for their file extensions) as a single unit for version control operations.  For example, if you develop code in C++, often when you want to modify a C++ source file, you need also to modify the header file associated with that source file.  If you create a C++ file group, and include cpp, and h files in that group, whenever you select either a .cpp file or a .h file, the client application will automatically select the other file(s) with the same name.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/userFileGroupsDialogGeneral.png" alt="Define File Groups Dialog"></p>
<p>To Create a file group, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <b>Admin&rarr;Define File Groups...</b> menu item in the client application.</li>
<li>On the Define File Groups dialog, click the <b>New...</b> button, and on the resulting dialog, enter the name that you want to associate with the file group into the "File Group Name" edit box.  The name should just be a simple descriptive name that helps you identify the purpose of the group;  an appropriate name might be "Delphi Development", "Visual Basic Development", or "PowerBuilder Development", etc.</li>
<li>Enter the file extensions that compose the file group into the "File Group file extensions:" edit box, separating the file extensions with a comma or space.  A sample group for C++ might look like:  "h c cpp"  (without the quote characters).</li>
<li>Click the "OK" button.</li>
<li>To enable the file groups that you define, just enable the "Enable File Groups" check box at the top of the dialog, and click the OK button.</li>
</ul>

<p>File extensions can exist in only one file group at a time.  For example, you are not allowed to create a "C++ file group" that has "c,cpp,h" file extensions, and a "C file group" that has "c,h" extensions, since the "c,h" extensions overlap between the two groups.</p>
