<h1>Automatic Updates</h1>
<p>QVCS-Enterprise server can automatically update its clients -- gui_out.jar, admin_out.jar, and the IDE .dll. For the automatic update feature to work, you must first install a 2.0.8 (or later) release of QVCS-Enterprise on both server, and on your clients. Once that is done, then for any subsequent updates, you need only update the copy of server_out.jar on your server. When out-of-date clients connect to the new version of the server, the application will detect the version mismatch, and ask the user if they want to update their client. If they answer yes, then the server will send an updated client jar file to the client. That jar file will have a .new file extension appended to it. The client will then exit. When the client starts the next time, the gui.bat (or gui.sh) script will check for .new jar files. If it finds any, it renames them to the appropriate name, and then launches the new client application.</p>
<p>The gui.bat script takes care of updates to both gui_out.jar and the IDE client .dll. The gui.sh script takes care of updates for gui_out.jar -- there is no need for it to update the IDE client .dll, since the .dll cannot be used in *NIX environments.</p>
<p>The admin.bat and admin.sh scripts take care of updates for the admin_out.jar file.</p>
<p>Automatic client updates make it much easier to coordinate updates to QVCS-Enterprise, since the server_out.jar is the only file you need to update.</p>
