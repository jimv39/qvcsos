Each branch has a separate location for that branch's workfiles. Typically, branches are used to isolate different lines of development. For example, user A might be working to create feature A while user B might be working on feature B. They could create separate branches for their work, and then promote their features to a parent branch when they finished their respective work.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td valign=top><a name="tag"></a><b>tag</b></td><td>A tag is just a string that you use to mark some point of development for a given branch. Typically, you apply/create a tag for a branch when you want to identify some significant point of progress for the given branch... maybe to define a release, or the completion of some feature, etc. Tags are durable, and just capture the commit id at the time of their creation.</td></tr>
