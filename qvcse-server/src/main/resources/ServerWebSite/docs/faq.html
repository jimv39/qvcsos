                                <p class="faq"><a name="qg0"></a>What is "version control"?
                                <p class="faqa">Wikipedia has a good background article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control systems</a>. In summary, version Control Systems and QVCS serve a number of purposes. These include:
                                <ul class="faq"><li class="news">Automate the tracking of files as they change during the course of a development project.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Prevent 'collisions' between multiple developers on the same project by preventing multiple edits to the same file at the same time.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Provide the ability to recover previous revisions of files.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Allow multiple lines of development to proceed at the same time for a single file.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Audit the development process so you can keep track of who changes which file, when they make the change, and what changes they make.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Reduce storage requirements.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Labeling a group of file revisions for a product release.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Create reports to show what files have changed between product releases.</li></ul>
                                <p class="faqa">This list is not exhaustive, but it gives you a sample of the kinds of things that QVCS can do for you. QVCS lets you make changes to the files of your project with the confidence that you can go back to previous snapshots of those files if you need to.

                                <p class="faqa">There are 1195 files in the product, including Java source files, ant build scripts, and web site files.</p>

                                <p class="faqa">QVCS-Enterprise should work on any platform that has a Java 8 JVM available for it. We develop primarily on MacOS, and test on Linux and MacOS and using Oracle's JVMs on all platforms..</p>

                                <p class="faq"><a name="qse1"></a>Where do I find the client log file?</p>
                                <p class="faqa">The client log file will generally be located in the same directory as the gui_out.jar file. The log file will have a name like qvcsEnterpriseClient0.log.</p>
                                <p class="faqa">You can change the location of this file by manually editing the guiLogging.properties file that's located in the same directory as the gui_out.jar file. That properties file is pretty well commented. Look for the line that looks like:</p>
                                <p class="faqa"><code>java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = qvcsEnterpriseClient%u.log</code></p>
                                <p class="faqa">You can change the file name to the right of the equal sign to some more suitable name and/or location.</p>

                                <p class="faq"><a name="qse2"></a>Where do I find the server log file?</p>
                                <p class="faqa">The server log file will generally be located in the same directory as the qvcse-server-VERSION.jar file (where VERSION is the version of QVCS-Enterprise). The log file will have a name like QVCSEnterpriseServer0.log.</p>
                                <p class="faqa">You can change the location of this file by manually editing the serverLogging.properties file that's located in the same directory as the qvcse-server-VERSION.jar file.

                                <p class="faqa"><u>On the server:</u></p>
                                <p class="faqa">On the server, you should backup the server installation directory, and all directories beneath that directory. The server installation directory is the one containing the qvcse-server-VERSION.jar file. If you use the default locations for the archive storage, this backup strategy will include all the QVCS archives for all the projects hosted on that server. You should perform server backups on a regular basis.</p>
                                <p class="faqa"><u>On the clients:</u></p>
                                <p class="faqa">On the client, you <i>may</i> want to backup the client install directory (the one containing the gui_out.jar file) and all its sub-directories. Backup on the client is not so critical as server backups, in that data on the client can be regenerated without too much effort.</p>
