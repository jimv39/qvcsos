<h1>Labels</h1>
<p>Working with QVCS labels is among the most important things to understand in order to get the most out of QVCS-Enterprise. If you are not using labels, then please read on to see why they are an important addition to your toolkit.</p>
<p>What is a <a href="glossary.html#label">label</a>?</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, (as noted in the glossary), a label is just a string that you associate with a specific revision within an archive file. However, since you can associate that same label string with revisions in more than one file, a label becomes a way for you to create a set (in the mathematical sense) of file revisions that are all associated with that same label string.</p>
<p>QVCS-Enterprise supports two different kinds of labels:</p>
<ul class="news"><li class="news">Static labels</li>
<li class="news">Floating labels</li></ul>
<h2>Static Labels</h2>
<p>Static labels are always associated with a <i>specific</i> revision within an archive file. Static labels are typically used to identify the set of revisions that compose a specific product release. For example, when we produce a product release of QVCS-Enterprise, we apply a static label to all the files that are part of that release. Later, if/when we need to answer questions about that release, we can use the static label to identify what the source code looked like for that specific release. Or, we can use that static label as a starting point if we need to produce a product release that fixes a bug that has been found in that release.</p>
<h2>Floating Labels</h2>
<p>Floating labels are always associated with the tip revision on the file branch that they are associated with. For example, if you apply a floating label to the TRUNK, then that floating label will always 'point' to the tip revision on the TRUNK. If you apply a floating label to a branch, then that floating label will always 'point' to the tip revision of that branch. Floating labels are typically used to define a set (in the mathematical sense) of <i>files</i>, as opposed to a set of <i>revisions</i>.</p>
<h2>Duplicating Labels</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a static label that you used to define the set of revisions that compose a release. You release your product, and some of your customers discover a bug in that release. Meanwhile, you have already started work on the next release, and have checked in a number of changes that have nothing at all to do with changes that you will need to make in order to fix the reported bug. You want to be able to create a bug-fix release that has <i>just</i> the changes needed to fix the bug. What to do?</p>
<p>The very first thing to do is to duplicate the original static label. For example, if the original label was 2.1.8, you could duplicate that label, using a new label string of 2.1.8.1.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/applyDuplicateLabel.png" alt="Apply Duplicate Label Dialog"></p>
<p>After duplicating the label, you can checkout the revisions that need to change by checking out 'by label', (using the 2.1.8.1 label). When you check your changes back in, apply the 2.1.8.1 label at checkin. You can then do a build, using the 2.1.8.1 label to fetch all the revisions that compose the new bug-fix release. Your new 2.1.8.1 release will be identical to your 2.1.8 build except for the changes you made to fix the bug(s).</p>
<p>When you duplicate a label, (whether duplicating a static label, or floating label), the new label, by default, is a static label. If you want the new label to be a floating label, you need to enable the 'Make this a floating label' checkbox.</p>
<h2>Other Label Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is no limit to the number of labels that can be associated with a given file or revision.</li>
<li>Floating labels can be a handy way to define a set of files. Combined with a file filter which shows only those files that have a given label, you can use floating labels to create arbitrary file groups.</li>
<li>Labels can be used as a poor-man's way of defining change-sets, or defining a set of revisions that together implement some feature or bug-fix.</li>
<li>Any file that is a member of the set of files that compose your product should have a floating label that identifies it as a member of that file set. For example, here, for the QVCS-Enterprise product, every file that is needed to build the product is labeled with the 'QVCS-Enterprise Product' floating label. This makes it very easy to create a release based on the latest revisions of all the files in that set: just duplicate the 'QVCS-Enterprise Product' floating label with a new static label, and then do a 'get' and build, using that new static label.</li>
<li>Using the 'get by label' ant task makes it very easy to automate your build process.</li>
