                                <p>QVCSOS-Enterprise has been a long time in the making. Many of its features are the result of requests from QVCS and QVCS-Pro users who over the years have been frustrated by their inability to use those products when working with geographically dispersed peers.</p>
                                <p>Some of these QVCS and QVCS-Pro users volunteered to help test QVCSOS-Enterprise as it neared completion. Our thanks goes to those whose suggestions and complaints have shaped the feature set of QVCSOS-Enterprise.</p>
                                <p>Thanks also go to our beta testers who have helped flesh out the product from an early beta through to the product release. The product you see has many fewer bugs as a result of their patience and guidance.</p>
                                <p>A special thanks goes to Timo Haberkern whose able testing efforts have made this product one that is more usable.</p>
