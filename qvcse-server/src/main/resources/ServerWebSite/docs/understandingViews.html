                                <h1>Views</h1>
                                <p>A <b>View</b> is a way to look at a QVCS project.  When you first create a
                                    QVCS project, QVCS-Enterprise will automatically create the <i>Trunk</i> view --
                                    which is the default way of looking at a QVCS project.</p>
                                <h1>View behavior is undergoing a <i>MAJOR</i> refactoring... so they really are not working in any useful way at this writing.</h1>
                                <p>You can create additional views of a project by right clicking on a project node and selecting <b>Define View...</b> 
                                    from the context menu. This will bring up a dialog allowing you to define the kind of view you want to create.</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="../images/defineview.png" alt="Define View Dialog"></p>
                                <p>QVCS-Enterprise 3.X supports three different kinds of views:</p>
                                <ul class="news">
                                    <li class="number">The Trunk <i>(the default)</i></li>
                                    <li class="number">Read-only date-based views <b>(DOES NOT WORK)</b></li>
                                    <li class="number">Translucent views <b>(DOES NOT WORK)</b></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The <b>Trunk</b> view is the default view. There can be only one Trunk view. When you create a project, this is the view you start out with. It serves both as the central location for the archive files and information for a project, and as the base for other views. Normally, you'll do most of your work on the Trunk view.</p>
                                <p>A <b>read-only date-based view</b> is a view constructed with some date you define. Given that date, the view will display what the project looked like at the given date/time. Because of the way it works, the earliest date you can use is the install date of the 2.1 release. In any case, the view will contain the project files as they existed at that point in time -- all filenames and file locations will be the names and locations that were in use at the given time; also, any files that were deleted <i>after</i> the given date/time will still show up. It's like a time machine.</p>
                                <p>A <b>Translucent</b> view is much like what other products (e.g. git) call a Feature branch... except with a translucent view, the parent branch (usually the Trunk) changes become immediately visible to the translucent branch. They allow you to work on your feature and know what is changing underneath on the Trunk. Changes on a translucent view can be promoted to its parent view (usually the Trunk).</p>
