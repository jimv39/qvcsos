                                <p>There are several directories and files that QVCSOS-Enterprise client and server use. These files are located in the directories that are located beneath the directory where you install the QVCSOS-Enterprise jar files.</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="../images/directories.png" border=1 alt="directories"></p>
                                <p>Many of these files are created <i>after</i> running the client or server.</p>

                                <p></p><hr><p></p>
                                <p>The lib directory contains 3rd party jar files that are needed for the client and/or server, as well as QVCSOS jar files used by the applications.</p>
                                <p></p><hr><p></p>

                                <p>The logs directory contains the log files of the respective qvcsos applications.</p>

                                <p>This directory is created on the server. It contains a single file: qvcs.server.journal.</p>
                                <p>This journal file contains a chronological record of activities performed by the server. The server continually appends to this file as activities are performed. You can safely delete this file (when the server has been stopped). It is meant to serve as a record of server activities. The server never <i>reads</i> from this file.</p>

                                <p></p><hr><p></p>
                                <p>The qvcsBehaviorProperties directory contains:</p>
                                <ul class="news">
                                    <li class="news">qvcs.postgresql.connection.properties <i>(server)</i></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The <u>qvcs.postgresql.connection.properties</u> file is a property file that defines the server's connection to a Postgresql database. In order to use a Postgresql database server, you need to create the database that the qvcsos server will use.</p>
                                <p>You can use the postgres_qvcsos410_prod_script.sql SQL script located in the qvcsos/testenterprise directory of the git repository to create this using the Postgresql psql tool.</p>
                                <p></p><hr><p></p>
                                <h2>Files in the qvcsMetaData directory</h2>
                                <p></p><hr><p></p>
                                <p>The files contained on the client in the qvcsMetaData directory look like:</p>
                                <ul class="news">
                                    <li class="news">qvcs.workfileDigestStore.<i>username</i>.dat <i>(client)</i></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The <u>qvcs.workfileDigestStore.<i>username</i>.dat</u> will exist only on client machines. It caches digest values for the workfiles of an individual user. The username portion of the file name defines the name of the user that it is associated with. In addition to the digest value for the workfile, it also captures that timestamp associated with the creation of the workfile; i.e. when QVCSOS-Enterprise 'gets' a workfile copy from the server, it knows when that happens. The workfile digest store has this timestamp information in it as well. That timestamp information combined with the digest value allows the QVCSOS-Enterprise client to deduce the value to display in the 'File Status' column. If you delete this file, then QVCSOS-Enterprise can still compare the digest values to determine if the workfile is different than the most recent file revision, but if the file is different, it cannot deduce whether the file has been edited locally, or if the file is out of date because a new revision has been checked in. In the case that the timestamp information is missing from this file, and the file is different than the tip revision of the file, then the 'File Status' column will display just a value of 'Different', since nothing more can be known. As you perform 'gets', the timestamp information is added to the store, and the 'File Status' column can become more accurate.</p>

                                <p>This directory is created on the client.</p>
                                <p>This directory contains the .html files for any reports generated on the client. The QVCS client creates files in this directory when you select the Reports/Generate Report menu option. You have to manually delete these report files whenever you wish; the client application will <b>not</b> delete these files.</p>

                                <p>This directory contains property files that define the servers known to the client. The files have a name like qvcs.servername.<i>server name</i>.properties. They contain definition of the ports the client uses to connect to the given server, as well as the server's IP address.</p>
