                                <h1>QVCS-Enterprise User Manual</h1>
                                <p>This is the user manual for <a href="https://github.com/jimv39/qvcsos">QVCS-Enterprise</a>.</p>
                                <p>QVCS-Enterprise is a simple to use version control product that allows you to capture snapshots of the files you work with. It is implemented as a client/server application. Its client/server nature allows it to provide good performance when used over the Internet.</p>
                                <p>This release of QVCS-Enterprise provides these version control features:</p>
                                <ul class="news"><li class="news">Add files to version control.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Check in file revisions to capture changes to the files that you have under version control.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Get file revisions from the server so you can recover past work if required.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Label file revisions so you can later recover the revisions that share the same label.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Remove labels.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Visually compare your work to past revisions with a built-in visual compare tool.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Visually compare your work to past revisions using any external visual compare tool that can be launched from the command line.</li>
                                    <li class="news">See at a glance which of your files have changed or are out of date.</li>
                                    <li class="news">See all the files of a project's directory tree in a single file list pane.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Merge (automatically or visually) two separate edits to the same file.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Keyword support for automated generation of useful audit information.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Simple branching support.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Client file group support. A file group is the set of files that have the same file name, but different file extensions. If enable and define file groups, then selecting one member of a file group will automatically select all members of that same file group.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Simple reporting based on file and revision filter criteria.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Rename a file.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Use drag-and-drop to move a file from one project directory to another directory in the same project.</li>
                                    <li class="news">Delete a directory.</li>
                                    <li class="news">And more...</li></ul>
                                <p>QVCS-Enterprise includes a separate administrator's application that must be used to define projects, users, and user roles for the defined projects.</p>
                                <p>QVCS-Enterprise also includes a custom ANT task that can be used to provide simple version control behaviors from within an ANT build file. ANT support is provided instead of providing any command line tool support for this Java based application since it can provide better performance than a Java based command line tool.</p>
