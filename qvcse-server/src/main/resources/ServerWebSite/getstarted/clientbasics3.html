                                <h2><a name="get"></a>Retrieving a Revision</h2>
                                <p>Let's first familiarize ourselves with the most basic QVCS operation: the get operation. When you perform a 'get' on a file, the client will retrieve the requested revision from the server and save that revision to your copy of the work file. You will use this operation most frequently when updating your copy of a project file which another member of your team has been working on. You can also use it to obtain a copy of an older file revision stored in the database.</p>
                                <p>Since you just added your files to the project, all of them are up-to-date, so you'll have to delete one of them in order to see that Enterprise does anything. To do this, select a file, right click to get the context menu, and then choose the 'Delete Workfile...' menu option. Select 'Yes' on the resulting dialog.</p>
                                <p>Select the View/Refresh menu option to refresh the display. The file status of your file should now read as "Missing," to show that Enterprise cannot find the associated work file. However, it still has a copy of the file in the database. To retrieve this copy, select the missing file and click the Get File <img src="../images/smget.png" alt="get"> toolbar icon. The client will fetch the latest revision (in this case the only revision, 1.0) from the server and copy it to the work file location. The file status will return to "Current."</p>
                                <p>As it's assumed you'll most often use the get operation to update your work files, performing a get from the toolbar will not bring up a dialog. To fetch any older revision from the server, select <b>Get...</b> from either the <b>File</b> menu or the context menu that appears when you right click on a file.</p>
                                <p>The get operation is also one of a few that Enterprise can perform on a project-wide or directory level. If you need to update a number of files, you can right click on a project node or directory and select <b>Get...</b> from the context menu. This will bring up a dialog allowing you to get the files.</p>
