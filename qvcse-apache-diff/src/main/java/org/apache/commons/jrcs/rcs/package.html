    JRCS is a library that knows how to manipulate the archive files
    produced by the RCS and CVS version control systems. 
    <p>
      JRCS is not intended to replace RCS nor CVS. JRCS was written to
      be able create archive analysis tools that can do things like
      identify hot spots in the source code, measure the contributions
      by each developer, or assess how bugs make it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons why JRCS has the ability do do check-ins and save
      archives is API symmetry, and to simplify the writing of unit
      tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link org.apache.maven.jrcs.rcs rcs} package implements th8e
      archive handling functionality. The entry point to the library is
      class {@link org.apache.maven.jrcs.rcs.Archive Archive}.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CAVEAT UTILITOR:</b> Do not make modifications to your
      archives with JRCS. There needs to be an important amount of
      additional testing before it's safe to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link org.apache.maven.jrcs.diff diff} package implements
      the differencing engine that JRCS uses. The engine has the power
      of Unix diff, is simple to understand, and can be used
      independently of the archive handling functionality. The entry
      point to the differencing engine is class {@link
      org.apache.maven.jrcs.diff.Diff Diff}.

    <h2>
      Package Dependencies
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Jakarta ORO Regexp
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Jakarta ORO Regexp library is used for RCS keyword
      management. You can get a copy of Jakarta ORO from:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/">http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A copy of Jakarta Regexp is included in the full distribution of
      this library.
    </p>
    <h3>
      JavaCC
    </h3>
    <p>
      The RCS parser is constructed using the JavaCC compiler compiler.
      You can get a copy of JavaCC from:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://www.metamata.com/javacc/">http://www.metamata.com/javacc/</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JavaCC is not distributable, so you must get a copy of it
      yourself if you intend to use it. Keep in mind that, as
      distributed, this library does not require JavaCC to be compiled
      because all the JavaCC generated .java files are included.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide to use JavaCC, please adjust the "javacc.lib.dir"
      property as needed. You'll also need to download the set of
      optional tasks for Ant.
    </p>
    <h3>
      JUnit
    </h3>
    <p>
      The library tests are written for the JUnit Testing Framework.
