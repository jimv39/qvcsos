      The {@link org.apache.maven.jrcs.diff diff} package implements
      the differencing engine that JRCS uses. The engine has the power
      of Unix diff, is simple to understand, and can be used
      independently of the archive handling functionality. The entry
      point to the differencing engine is class {@link
      org.apache.maven.jrcs.diff.Diff Diff}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Text is represented as <code>Object[]</code> because the diff
      engine is capable of handling more than plain ascci. In fact,
      arrays of any type that implements {@link
      java.lang.Object#hashCode hashCode()} and {@link
      java.lang.Object#equals equals()} correctly can be subject to
      differencing using this library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two implementations of the differencing algorithm are provided.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        {@link SimpleDiff Simple Diff} is a verys imple algorithm that
        is fast and works well with very large input sequences, but
        that frequently produces result that are subotimal (at times
        four or more times larger than GNU diff).
      </li>
      <li>
        {@link org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff.myers.MyersDiff MyersDiff}
        is an implementation of <a href=
        "http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/gene/">Gene Myers</a>
        differencing algorithm. Myer's algorithm produces optimum
        results (minimum diffs), but consumes considerably more memory
        than SimpleDiff, so its not suitable for very large files.
      </li>
    </ul>
