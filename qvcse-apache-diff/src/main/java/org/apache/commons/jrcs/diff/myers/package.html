      The {@link org.apache.maven.jrcs.diff.myers diff.myers} package
      implements  <a href=
      "http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/gene/">Gene Myers</a>'
      differencing algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myer's algorithm produces optimum results (minimum diffs), but
      consumes considerably more memory than SimpleDiff, so its not
      suitable for very large files.
